Problem: Subarray with Maximum Product
Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray within the array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product. The array can contain both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros.

Example:
Input:

arr = [2, 3, -2, 4]
Output:

6 (The subarray [2, 3] has the maximum product)
Input:

arr = [-2, 0, -1]
Output:

0 (The subarray [0] has the maximum product)
Input:

arr = [-2, 3, -4]
Output:

24 (The subarray [3, -4] has the maximum product)
Constraints:
The array can contain both positive and negative integers, as well as zeros.
The length of the array can be up to 10^5.
Tasks:
Implement a function that finds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.
Try to solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Bonus (Optional):
Return the subarray itself, in addition to the maximum product.
